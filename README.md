# Gosu Forum Software

This is a copy of the [mwForum](http://www.mwforum.org/) software with several additions:

* A few addons by @Quit ([more information](http://www.mwforum.org/forum/board_show.pl?bid=16))
* The Gosu forum theme
* mwForum's dependencies, inside the `code/` folder

Each of these projects has its own license, no code is mixed or modified. The parts that I have contributed are licensed under the MIT license.
